// banjo-nx: on/off switches for every performance enhancement.
//
// Each enhancement has its own cvar (toml key) and belongs to one of two groups; it is active only when its own key
// AND its group's master switch are on:
//   banjo_cpu_enhancements     host CPU work: guest-code replacements, waits, thread usage
//   banjo_noncpu_enhancements  GPU / driver / storage side: shader compile cost, caches, prewarming
// The startup log has one line listing every enhancement and whether it is active (LogEnhancements), so a console log
// says exactly what ran. Build-time changes (the shader library, compiler flags) are listed in docs/enhancements.md.
