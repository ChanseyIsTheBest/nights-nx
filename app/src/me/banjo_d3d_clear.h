// banjo-nx: Direct3D's Clear as an operation the renderer understands (2026-10-14). The first piece of the API-level
// layer of docs/d3d-native.md that changes what the renderer does, not only what the game threads cost.
//
// What it fixes. Direct3D clears a surface with a rectangle list of strips. The renderer takes every EDRAM tile a strip
// covers whole without a transfer, but the surface's last tile column (and last tile row) is covered only in part: a
// 1024-wide shadow map has a pitch of 1040, so each tile of its right column holds 64 surface pixels and 16 pixels of
// pitch padding. To stay exact the renderer copies those padding pixels in from whichever view owned the tile before
// (another shadow cascade, a colour target at the same EDRAM address), with the stencil passes when the old owner had
// stencil. On the console's level that was about 140 transfers a frame and 23 ms of GPU time a frame at stock clocks
// (renut_003 of 2026-10-14: every top transfer pair had Direct3D's clear shaders as its consumer).
//
// What the layer adds. A hook on Direct3D's one-rectangle clear (sub_82223560; its only caller is D3DDevice_Clear's
// per-rectangle step sub_822811A0) writes a marker NOP into the command buffer before Direct3D's own packets: the
// rectangle, the sizes of the bound colour target 0 and depth surface (from the surface objects, as sub_822811A0 reads
// them), and the flags; a second marker after them. The ring (me_native_system.cpp) then knows that the rectangle list
// between the markers is a Clear of the whole surface, and widens its overwrite rectangles over the surface's own pitch
// padding and the rest of its last tile row: those tiles are taken whole.
//
// The padding is then whatever the view's image held: no surface reads it (a surface's draws and resolves stay inside
// its width and height), and a surface that shares the EDRAM clears its own area before it uses it. That is the one
// assumption, and banjo_diag_clear_padding = 1 tests it: the padding is filled with a loud value (magenta, depth 0.37)
// after each widened clear, so a read would show on screen (compare halves with banjo_ab_target = 20).
//
// Key banjo_d3d_api_clear (non-CPU, on by default); in-run A/B target 20 switches the ring's use of the markers (the
// markers are written either way).
