"""banjo-nx: writes the A/B test configs from the shipped renut.toml (docs/enhancements.md).

Each variant is the base config with a few keys changed, so two logs compare directly:
  banjo_cpu_on.toml      every enhancement as shipped (profiled, like every config but verify)
  banjo_cpu_off.toml     CPU master switch off (each CPU enhancement back to the original path)
  banjo_noncpu_off.toml  non-CPU master switch off (shader prewarm, Mesa cache, per-stage cache)
  banjo_all_off.toml     both master switches off
  banjo_profile.toml     as cpu_on, plus the app's own sampler (banjo_profiler.log)
  banjo_cpu_verify.toml  every CPU enhancement on (banjo_direct_state too) AND checked against its original path on every use; the log's
                         "[verify] ... differences: N" line must say 0. Profiling OFF. Slower: a test session only
  banjo_direct_ab.toml   as cpu_on plus banjo_direct_state, which turns itself off and on every 4 s: the log's
                         "ring thread A/B" line gives the ring's time with and without it from one run
  banjo_memo_ab.toml     the same for banjo_ring_edram_memo
  banjo_upload_uncached.toml  as cpu_on but the upload buffer in uncached memory (the A/B of upload_memory = 1)
  banjo_logwriter_off.toml    as cpu_on but the file log written by the logging thread itself (the A/B of
                              log_file_writer: compare the hitch frames around the ring's 10 s reports)
  banjo_cpu_rounds_off.toml  the three run-time keys of sa2-nx's CPU rounds off (the rest of them is in the NRO)
  banjo_tiles_once_ab.toml         as cpu_on, the single-pass scene (banjo_gpu_tiles_once) off and on every 4 s: the
                                   "ring thread A/B" line gives the ring's time per Swap for both from one run
  banjo_vertex_persistent_ab.toml  the same for the persistent vertex buffer (banjo_ring_vertex_persistent)
  banjo_emulation_items_off.toml   the 2026-10-13 evening items off (EDRAM proofs, tiles once, persistent vertices):
                                   the renderer as in the 2026-10-13_1411 build, with the texture fixes kept
  banjo_shader_load_memo_ab.toml   in-run A/B of banjo_ring_shader_load_memo (the "ring thread A/B" line)
  banjo_zcull_greater.toml         console trial: the driver's ZCULL in the direction of Banjo's reversed-depth scene
                                   (whole run; compare the "scene" figure of the "GPU per Swap" lines of two runs)
  banjo_shaders25_ab.toml          package 25's shader round (targets 49-54) switched together every 4 s; each key has its
                                   own config too (banjo_clamp_cbuf_ab, banjo_sign_mask_skip_ab, banjo_vs_outputs_
                                   unwritten_ab, banjo_bone_padding_ab, banjo_robustness_off_ab, banjo_edram_checks_cpu_ab)
  banjo_shaders25_off.toml         package 25's six shader keys off for a whole run
  banjo_deferred_off.toml          deferred recording off for a whole run (on by default since package 25, its
                                   worker on core 0: package 24b's A/B gave -12 % a draw on the executor)
  banjo_gpu_test.toml              banjo_gpu_zcull_greater + banjo_diag_gpu_groups = 2 in one run (the two GPU
                                   questions of 2026-10-14: does ZCULL in the reversed direction cut the scene's time,
                                   and which shaders the scene's time goes to)
  banjo_all_tests.toml             GPU groups + the Clear markers' A/B (GPU and ring) in one run (2026-10-14)
  banjo_api_ops_off.toml           the API layer's operations off (Clear, Resolve, dead draws) (2026-10-14)
  banjo_dead_draws_ab.toml         banjo_gpu_skip_dead_draws switched every 4 s (2026-10-14)
  banjo_early_alpha_ab.toml        banjo_gpu_early_alpha switched every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups: the GPU A/B
                                   line gives both halves' GPU time (2026-10-15)
  banjo_index_persistent_ab.toml   banjo_ring_index_persistent switched every 4 s (the "ring thread A/B" line)
  banjo_texture_signs_ab.toml      banjo_gpu_texture_signs_per_slot switched every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups
  banjo_clear_merge_ab.toml        banjo_gpu_edram4_clear_merge switched every 4 s, with the GPU groups
  banjo_vfetch_block_ab.toml       banjo_gpu_vfetch_block switched every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups
  banjo_branchless_ab.toml         banjo_gpu_branchless_select switched every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups
  banjo_bool_spec_ab.toml          banjo_gpu_bool_spec switched every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups

  banjo_lean_barriers_ab.toml      banjo_gpu_edram4_lean_barriers switched every 4 s, with the GPU groups
  banjo_resolve_clear_merge_ab.toml banjo_gpu_resolve_clear_merge switched every 4 s, with the GPU groups
  banjo_pred_select_ab.toml        banjo_gpu_pred_select (vertex shaders' predicated blocks flattened) switched every 4 s,
                                   with the per-shader GPU groups (2026-10-16)
  banjo_pred_select_ps_ab.toml     banjo_gpu_pred_select_ps (the same for pixel shaders) switched every 4 s, with the
                                   per-shader GPU groups (2026-10-16)
  banjo_tess_grid_ab.toml          banjo_gpu_tess_grid (the water's tessellated patches drawn as an indexed grid)
                                   switched every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups (2026-10-16)
  banjo_shaders21_ab.toml          the whole shader round of 2026-10-16 (targets 29, 37, 38, 39) switched together
                                   every 4 s, with the per-shader GPU groups
  banjo_ring_core_ab.toml          the ring thread pinned to core 1 (banjo_ring_core) against the whole core mask, every
                                   4 s (the "ring thread A/B" and "GPU A/B" lines give both halves)
  banjo_ring_decoder_ab.toml       banjo_ring_decoder (the ring split: a decoder thread and the ring as executor)
                                   against one item at a time, every 4 s (2026-10-16)
  banjo_vs_hash_given_ab.toml      banjo_ring_vs_hash_given (the vertex input key takes the program hash of its load)
                                   switched every 4 s (2026-10-16)
  banjo_d3d_records_ab.toml        banjo_d3d_records (records of every Direct3D call's packets: the decoder parses no
                                   PM4 for them) switched every 4 s (2026-10-16, step 4)
  banjo_d3d_records_native_ab.toml banjo_d3d_records_native (the native draw path writes its records itself) switched
                                   every 4 s (step 5)
  banjo_d3d_host_submit_ab.toml    banjo_d3d_host_submit (the kicks through a host queue: the primary ring not
                                   parsed) switched every 4 s (step 6)
  banjo_d3d_records_off.toml       steps 4-6 off for a whole run (the decoder parses the PM4, as in package 23)
  banjo_ring_decoder_off.toml      the ring split off for a whole run (the ring decodes and executes, as before)
  banjo_ring_decoder_core0.toml    the decoder thread on core 0 (main thread) instead of core 2 (deferred worker)
  banjo_stencil_fetch_3d_probe.toml  every EDRAM stencil import through the 3D engine's masked passes (no copy
                                   engine; exact either way): what the late stencil fetch costs there
  banjo_shaders_old.toml           the shader-size work of 2026-10-15 off for a whole run (per-slot signs, bone
                                   fetches, branch-free selects, unread vertex outputs, merged clears): compare with a
                                   run of renut.toml
  banjo_fragments.toml             measurement: fragments shaded per pass category, every frame (the Mfrag figures of
                                   the "GPU per Swap" lines), with the GPU time by draw state and pixel shader
  banjo_diagnostics.toml           every GPU measurement at once: one serialized frame every 10 s measured per draw (GPU
                                   time, fragments and ns per fragment per pixel shader), GPU groups, the driver's
                                   shader statistics, Vulkan commands / barriers / render passes per Swap with their
                                   call sites, the app's CPU sampler
  banjo_pmull_off.toml             banjo_ring_pmull_fingerprint off (the CRC32 pair hashes, as in the sixteenth package):
                                   compare RangeFingerprint's share of the ring thread in rex_profile.log (2026-10-15)
  banjo_d3d_native_off.toml        the native Direct3D draw path off (Direct3D's own draw functions run): compare the
                                   drawing threads' share in rex_profile.log with banjo_cpu_on.toml's
  banjo_deferred_ab.toml           the same trial as an in-run A/B: deferred recording off and on every 4 s; the
                                   "ring thread A/B" line gives the ring's time per Swap for both from one run
  banjo_deferred_ab_core2.toml     the same with the worker on core 2 (with the ring split's decoder) instead of 0
  banjo_transfers_off.toml         the 2026-10-14 EDRAM items off (banjo_gpu_dead_raster, banjo_gpu_rect_split,
                                   banjo_gpu_proof_depth_only, banjo_gpu_edram4_split_tiles): compare the
                                   "imports/exports" figures of the "GPU per Swap" lines with cpu_on's
  banjo_gpu_groups.toml            measurement: GPU time inside every pass by draw state and pixel shader
                                   (banjo_diag_gpu_groups = 2; the "GPU time by pass" lines get 48 entries)
  banjo_hot_functions_off.toml     every native copy of a hot game function off (the banjo_cpu_native_* keys of
                                   app/src/cpu/hot/localized.txt): the recompiled originals run, as before 2026-10-14.
                                   Compare the game threads' share in rex_profile.log with banjo_cpu_on.toml's
  banjo_hand_natives_off.toml      the hand-written natives of memcpy, memset and the four Direct3D writers off (the
                                   generated copies of those functions run instead): the A/B of 2026-10-14's natives
  banjo_renderer_renut.toml        package 26: Renut's renderer (banjo_renderer = "renut", docs/renut-renderer-port.md),
                                   with its GPU time per frame (renut_gpu_profile) and the frame rate every 10 s
                                   (since package 28 the same as renut.toml, which boots Renut's renderer)
  banjo_renut_vulkan.toml          package 29: renut.toml's settings with Renut's renderer on Vulkan (NVK), as up to
                                   package 28b
  banjo_renut_deko3d.toml          package 29: the same on the deko3d back end (docs/deko3d-renderer.md)
  banjo_renut_a2c_dither.toml      package 31: alpha to coverage drawn as before (the hardware's dither with MSAA off:
                                   the checker-patterned grass and fur edges), banjo_renut_alpha_to_mask_test off
  banjo_renut_words_no_stencil.toml  package 31: the depth resolve's words without the stencil (as before),

  banjo_renut_half_pixel_off.toml  package 32: everything drawn half a pixel up-left as before (the halo the depth of
                                   field made around Kazooie), banjo_renut_half_pixel_offset off
  banjo_deko3d_copied_resolves.toml  package 33: colour resolves copied on the copy engine as before (each copy idles
                                   the whole GPU), banjo_deko3d_draw_resolves off
  banjo_deko3d_words_copied.toml   package 33: the depth resolve's words copied for the depth of field every frame as
                                   before, banjo_gpu_depth_words_view off
  banjo_deko3d_depth_uncompressed.toml  package 33: depth targets without hardware compression as before,

  banjo_deko3d_gpu_before.toml     package 33: all four of the above off at once (package 32's GPU work)
  banjo_deko3d_uam_prmt_off.toml   package 33: uam without its new PRMT byte swaps (the shifts and masks as before), with
                                   a shader cache of its own (deko3d_shaders_f446.bin): if characters are missing or
                                   broken with renut.toml, this tells whether PRMT is why
  banjo_deko3d_uam_gvn_off.toml    package 34: uam without its value numbering (what a shader computes again is computed
                                   again), banjo_deko3d_uam_gvn off; a shader cache of its own, compiled as it goes
  banjo_deko3d_uam_uniform_branches_off.toml  package 34: uam keeps the SSY / SYNC pair around branches on constants
                                   (as before), banjo_deko3d_uam_uniform_branches off; a shader cache of its own
  banjo_renut_words_always.toml    package 34: every depth resolve writes its words again (as before),

  banjo_deko3d_depth_handover_off.toml  package 35: every depth resolve drawn when the game asks (as before; the shadow
                                   maps copied each frame), banjo_deko3d_depth_handover off
  banjo_deko3d_depth24_off.toml    package 35: D24S8 depth targets (the shadow maps) as 32-bit float again (as before),
                                   banjo_deko3d_depth24 off
  banjo_deko3d_push_constants_off.toml  package 35: the float constants and SharedConstants uploaded whole into the
                                   ring for every draw again (as before), banjo_deko3d_push_constants off: the render
                                   thread's A/B of the pushed constants (and the GPU's, which processes the updates)
  banjo_deko3d_kick_submit_off.toml  package 35: the frame's GPU work submitted only at the present (as before),
                                   banjo_deko3d_kick_submit off: the input latency A/B of the kick submits
  banjo_late_input_off.toml        package 35: the controller read at the start of the frame as before,
                                   banjo_late_input off: the input latency A/B of the late input
  banjo_deko3d_ring_cleaner_off.toml  package 35: the upload ring cleaned by the render thread at the submit (as
                                   before), banjo_deko3d_ring_cleaner off
  banjo_deko3d_txq_off.toml        package 36: texture size queries in the shaders again (banjo_deko3d_txq_constants
                                   off): the GPU A/B of the texture size buffer (A5E2, the fur shells)
  banjo_deko3d_txq_verify.toml     package 36, a test: queries and sizes both, magenta pixels where they differ
                                   (the variants compile at run time; not for timing)
  banjo_deko3d_early_z_off.toml    package 36: discarding pixel shaders of draws without depth or stencil writes
                                   tested after the shader again (banjo_deko3d_early_z off): the GPU A/B
  banjo_deko3d_gpr32_on.toml       package 36: the fur family compiled with 32 GPRs at most (banjo_deko3d_gpr32 on):
                                   the GPU A/B of occupancy against spills
  banjo_renut_stall_present_on.toml  package 36: the last frame re-presented while the game stalls, as before
                                   (banjo_renut_stall_present on): the A/B of the colour flash fix
  banjo_renut_diag_fur_vertex_only.toml  package 36b, a measurement: the fur family's pixel shaders discard at
                                   once (banjo_renut_diag_null_ps); the GPU profile then shows the fur draws'
                                   vertex cost (the fur vanishes; its shaders compile on the console)
  banjo_renut_game_gamma_on.toml   package 36b: the game's gamma ramp applied to the output, as a 360 shows it
                                   (banjo_renut_game_gamma on; darker midtones): to look at, the user's call
  banjo_deko3d_light_branch_on.toml  package 36c: the heaviest lit shaders' point lights in branches on their reach
                                   (banjo_deko3d_light_branch on): the GPU A/B
  banjo_renut_device_swizzle_off.toml  package 36c: textures sampled through their header's swizzle, as before
                                   (banjo_renut_device_swizzle off): the A/B of the second colour flash fix
  banjo_deko3d_light_branch_ab.toml  package 36c: banjo_deko3d_light_branch switched off and on every 4 s in one
                                   run (in-run A/B target 15): the "[renut A/B]" line's GPU times
  banjo_deko3d_gpr32_ab.toml       package 36c: the same for banjo_deko3d_gpr32 (target 16)
  banjo_renut_fur_shells_2.toml    package 36c, NOT exact: every 2nd fur shell drawn (banjo_renut_fur_shells 2): the
                                   look and the GPU time of thinner fur, the user's call
  banjo_deko3d_uam_wide_rows_off.toml  package 36d: the bone rows as four 32-bit loads, as before (the A/B of the
                                   128-bit rows; its cache deko3d_shaders_f447.bin is in the package)
  banjo_deko3d_latency_trim_on.toml  package 36e: input latency, the next frame recorded just in time where the GPU
                                   is the limit (banjo_deko3d_latency_trim): its [latency] lines against run (a)'s
  banjo_gpu_ab_pack.toml           package 36q: banjo_deko3d_light_branch and banjo_deko3d_gpr32 both on, each switched
                                   off in turn (banjo_renut_ab_targets "15,16"): one "[renut A/B]" line each, GPU ms

  banjo_renut_post_high.toml       Renut's renderer with its own default 16-bit post-processing buffers (the others use
                                   the console's 8-bit, renut_post_process_precision = "Game")
  banjo_renut_barriers_ab.toml / _pin_ab / _dedupe_ab / _push_ab / _pool_ab: Renut's renderer with its in-run A/B
                                   ("[renut A/B]" lines) of the precise barriers / the render thread's pin / the

                                   for cached vertex streams and index ranges costs)
  banjo_renut_exact_off.toml       package 27: Renut's own 4-frame background check of those copies (the "[renut]"
                                   line's "found stale late" counts the copies it would have drawn from stale)
  banjo_renut_memory_policy_off.toml  package 27: Renut's own memory limits (sized for a PC) on the console
  banjo_renut_eviction_test.toml   package 27, a TEST: texture eviction forced every 32 frames (a reserve larger than the
                                   budget) and released slots poisoned magenta: any magenta on screen is a bug
  banjo_renut_boolspec_ab.toml / _blendskip_ab / _tessgrid_ab: package 27, Renut's renderer's in-run A/B targets 7, 8
                                   and 9 (banjo_gpu_bool_spec, banjo_gpu_blend_skip, banjo_gpu_tess_grid)

                                   shader, the record worker's A/B every 4 s)
  banjo_renut_gpu_shaders.toml     package 28b, a measurement: the GPU profile split by pixel shader (the main
                                   1280x720 pass in ms, with draws a frame; the timestamps cost a little)
  banjo_renut_record_ab.toml       package 28b: in-run A/B target 14 (banjo_renut_record_worker: the command recording
                                   on a worker thread against the render thread alone)
  banjo_renut_trim_poison_test.toml  package 28, a TEST: the channels banjo_gpu_output_trim leaves out are 60000 instead
                                   of 0; the picture must be the same as with renut.toml (any change is a bug)
  banjo_pacing_game.toml           the game's own frame pacing instead of renut.toml's target_refreshRate = 0 +
                                   frame_cap = "30" (package 26)
  banjo_literals_cbuf_ab.toml      package 26: in-run A/B target 56 (literals from the constant registers)
  banjo_stencil_clear_partial_ab.toml  package 26: in-run A/B target 57 (partial stencil fetch before a Clear)
  banjo_import9_steps.toml         package 26 diagnostic: the 9-pass EDRAM import timed per step
  banjo_cpu_native_bulk_off.toml   2026-10-22: the bulk localized copies (localized_bulk.txt) all off: the A/B of the
                                   round (the hand-picked copies stay on)
  banjo_hot_guard_on.toml          2026-10-22: the native copies' guard back on (64 first calls per thread, then 1 in
                                   4096); renut.toml calls every copy directly
